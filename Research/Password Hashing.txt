----> Hashing is a one-way function where data is mapped to a fixed-length value. Hashing is primarily used for authentication

----> Cost is the number of times to run the hashing algorithm 

----> Salt is the additional set of characters added in the end of the hashed string


Available hashing Algorithms: md5(), sha1(), sha256(), password_hash()
Latest and recommended => password_hash() with algorithm PASSWORD_DEFAULT, PASSWORD_BCRYT


----> Password_hash() is the recommended method because the process is not easy to reverse as the algorithm
is specifically non-reversible. The algorithm will generate random set of strings for same password each time. Where as md5 will generate the same set of string for same password.


----> We will use Password_verify() to check and verify the password for user to login into application. Is it secure
because it will return 1 if the password is correct and 0 if not.
