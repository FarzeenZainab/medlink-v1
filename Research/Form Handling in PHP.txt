 TODO   Important  Client Side Validation


 TODO   Important  Server Side Validation

----> Server side validations are also required because a user can deactivate JS validation file and can send
malicious code to database. To secure the db from attacks we need to add another layer of security

server should check other requirements before submitting data into database


----> action for a form whose data will be processed in the same file will be 
        action = "<?php $_SERVER[PHP_SELF]?>"

        $_SESSION['PHP_SELF'] is vulnerable because it can be used by hackers
        to run harmfull scripts in the URL (Cross-server scripting attacks)

        To avoid these attack htmlspecialchars() is used to convert all special characters like < > " ' & to 
        html entities.

        & (ampersand) becomes &amp;
        " (double quote) becomes &quot;
        ' (single quote) becomes &#039;
        < (less than) becomes &lt;
        > (greater than) becomes &gt;

        

        to decode these entities back  to html characters we can use htmlspecialchar decode()
