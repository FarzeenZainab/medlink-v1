-- The medical history page should list all the doses 
    1. taken, 
    2. skipped 
    3. deleted
    4. edited 
by a user

-- The user should not be able to delete any record in the medical history table
-- The DB admin can have access to delete all the records

In database:
    1. create new table that will store the data when ever any change occured in the doses table
    2. write sql script, use triggers
    3. verify if the script is working

    ----> bug: 
            when using case statement in the trigger logic:
            case 
                when status_id = 1 then 'Dose taken'
                when status_id = 2 then 'Dose skipped'
                when status_id = 3 then 'Dose updated'
            end

            here the issue is when user edits the dose which is already marked
            as taken/skipped the action showed in the table is coming dose updated
            whereas, it should be taken + updated 



Front End:
    1. display all the records on front End

Back End
    1. Fetch all the records from user_medical_history table
