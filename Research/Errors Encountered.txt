PHP and MYSQL: Errors encountered in Programming


Registration Page:

   ----> 1. Calling multiple stored procedure without cleaning memory in sql result set
    Solution  use mysqli_free_result(query_statement_variable) and mysqli_next_result(connection_variable).
    mysqli_free_result will give an error on Insert and update statement becuase these statement does not return a 
    result sets, these statements returns boolen (true, false)



   ----> 2. errors occuring in mysql workbench are not visible when submitting data to MySQL workbench
    Solution  use mysqli_report(MYSQLI_REPORT_ERROR || MYSQLI_REPORT_STRICT); This will show the Errors
    occurred when sending or retreiving data from database

   ----> 3. Regular Expression for input validations

   ----> Error in fetching data from database
    Solution  use 

      "mysqli_fetch_object()" if using OOP or want to user objects syntax. Objects are mainly used to get data and methods of a class but in this case we are just reading data from a row.
      
      "mysqli_fetch_array" not recommened  becasue it will use indexed notation to access variables which will result difficulty in accessing data and readability
      
      "mysqli_fetch_assoc()" recommended way.

   ----> Convert array data to string
    Solution  There are two ways 
    implode();
    json_encode();

   ----> Not an ERROR -> when echoing print_r() 1 is appended, this is not an error, it is just the status
    if operation is successfull. It will appended zero next to the array if the process is failed
